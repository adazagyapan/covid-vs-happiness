# COVID-19 Spread/Death Rates vs. Happiness Rates

This COVID-19 data analysis project, based on two datasets of Johns Hopkins University, includes merging the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases/deaths and the data consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. The project aims to find a correlation between GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy and freedom to make life choices in a country and the spread/death rates of coronavirus there.

Please double check if the required libraries **(pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib)** are installed in your computer.
